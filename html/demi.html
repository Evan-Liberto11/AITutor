                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Demi Barnthouse. I grew up in the small town of Franklin, Ohio. I graduated from Franklin High School in May 2022
                    with High Honors and as a member of the National Honor Society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was a kid, I've always been more on the math and science side. These interests ended up leading me to the computer science field. Unsure at first,
                    I ended up loving the field and the satisfaction that came with it when the problem was solved. Now, as a Junior at Miami University, I've gained
                    plenty of knowledge and skill, and am set to graduate with my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in December 2025.  
                </p>
                <h3>My Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    This past semester and summer, I worked with the federal contracting company Modern Technology Solutions Inc. (MTSI), located in Dayton, Ohio, near the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. 
                    During my internship, I significantly enhanced my knowledge in programming techniques, team collaboration, Agile methodologies, and simulation concepts, while also honing my problem-solving 
                    abilities and understanding of professional development workflows.

                <p>
                    I contributed to the development of cockpit simulations using the MIXR (Mixed Reality Simulation Platform) framework and conducted data analysis with the AFSIM 
                    (Advanced Framework for Simulation, Integration, and Modeling) framework. Additionally, I utilized Git for version control, ensuring efficient team collaboration and project management.
                </p>

                <h3>Hobbies/Interest</h3>
                <p>
                    When I’m not busy with school or work, I like to spend time working to improve my skills. Golf has been a passion of mine since high school.
                    I enjoy seeing the growth each year and being able to play with friends and family. Beyond golf, I’m a big sports fan, particularly of football 
                    and baseball. I never miss an opportunity to cheer on my favorite teams.
                </p>
                <h3>Future Plans</h3>
                <p>
                    After college, I plan to continue working with my current employer, to expand my network and gain more experience in the field.
                    Eventually, I hope to pursue a Master’s degree in Business, with the goal of moving into a managerial or supervisory role down the line. 
                    I’m excited about the future and eager to keep learning and growing.
